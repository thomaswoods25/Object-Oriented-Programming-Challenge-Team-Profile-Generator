# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

Summary: With the 10th project, the most difficult project and time consuming project by far. I've completed it to the best of my ability, the object-oriented programming challenge using html, css, javascript, test javascript, and json.  I have watched numerous youtube videos and zoom recordings on the UNC bootcamp website. I have reached out to my ASKBCS, TAs during my office hours, my intructor during class hours and my acaedmic advisors to get all the proper knowledge from the resources I am provided. This project has defiently got me overwhelmed moving forward into the program of the bootcamp, but was very necessary in understanding the full development of front and back end web development.
